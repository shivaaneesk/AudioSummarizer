 Six humans tried to happen to him in dark and bitter cold. Each one per se as thick of wood or saw the story stalled. The dying fire in need of logs. The first woman held her back. For of the faces around the fire, she noticed one was black. The next man looking across the way saw not one of his church and couldn't bring himself to give the fire his thick of bush. The third one sat in tattered clothes. He gave his coat of hitch. Why should his log be put to use to warm the idle rich? The rich man just sat back and thought of the wealthy hadn't thought and how to keep what he had earned from the lazy shifliss poor. The black man's face was poker revenge. As the fire passed from sight, for all he saw in his thick of wood was a chance to fight the white. The last man of this fall on group did not accept forgave. Giving only to those who gave was how he played the game. The log felt tight in death's turn, with proof of human sin. They didn't die from the cold with up, they dried from the cold within.
